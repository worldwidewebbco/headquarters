# CI Pipeline for Headquarters
#
# Design decisions:
#
# 1. PARALLEL JOBS (not sequential steps)
#    - Faster feedback: all checks run simultaneously
#    - Clear failure attribution: easy to see what broke (lint vs test vs build)
#    - Selective re-runs: can retry just the failed job
#    - Trade-off: more runner minutes, but worth it for DX
#
# 2. FROZEN LOCKFILE
#    - Ensures CI uses exact same versions as local dev
#    - Fails fast if lockfile is out of sync with package.json
#    - Prevents "works on my machine" issues
#
# 3. PNPM VERSION FROM package.json
#    - Single source of truth (packageManager field)
#    - pnpm/action-setup@v4 auto-detects it
#    - Avoids version drift between local and CI
#
# 4. SEPARATE E2E JOB
#    - Browser install is slow (~30s), only needed for E2E
#    - Keeps other jobs fast
#    - E2E failures don't block lint/type/unit feedback
